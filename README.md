Some of Coconuts' features:

 * _authentication_: Coconuts uses Django's user system and you can create and
   manage your users with the admin interface.
 * _easy to manage_: photos and albums are simply stored as files and
   directories on the server
 * _thumbnails_: thumbnails are automatically generated as users browse albums
 * _touch friendly_: Coconuts features a clean and simple user interface which
   works well on tablets and smartphones. You can swipe between photos.
